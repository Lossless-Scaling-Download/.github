## Key Features

‚ú® **Frame Generation**  
Generate additional frames in games that lack native support (including emulators)

üéÆ **Upscaling Benefits**  
- Modern games: Play at higher resolutions when GPU-limited
- Older games: Eliminate blur from driver-level bilinear scaling
- Pixel-art games: Support modern resolutions and fullscreen mode

## Recommended Use Cases

- **Modern games**: LS1 or AMD FSR
- **Pixel-art games**: Integer Scaling or xBR
- **Anime/cartoons**: Anime4K
